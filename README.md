This project consists of all coursework-related projects completed as part of the academic curriculum, demonstrating the application of theoretical concepts through practical implementation and analysis.



🌍 GlobeTrail – Innovative Product Development (IPD)

GlobeTrail is an AI-powered travel itinerary planning platform developed as part of the Innovative Product Development (IPD) coursework during my 2nd and 3rd year of Engineering. The project focuses on personalized travel recommendations using machine learning, NLP, and clustering techniques. It integrates real-time data such as weather, traffic, and user preferences to generate dynamic, day-wise itineraries. The system also supports sentiment-based POI ranking and sustainable travel recommendations.



📊 Multidimensional Portfolio Risk & Performance Analysis (ML Project)

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning coursework during Semester 6 of Engineering. It is a data-driven portfolio analysis and optimization tool built using Python and Streamlit. The application evaluates portfolio performance using metrics such as CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, Volatility, and Drawdown, and performs advanced risk analysis using VaR, CVaR, and Monte Carlo simulations. It also generates the Efficient Frontier for optimal asset allocation and includes factor exposure analysis using the Fama-French model, making institutional-grade financial analytics accessible through an interactive interface.


📢 Professional & Business Communication – Storytelling Project (Sem V)

This project was completed as part of the Professional and Business Communication coursework during Semester 5 of Engineering. It focuses on corporate storytelling by analyzing LEGO’s brand journey, challenges, turnaround strategy, and long-term sustainability initiatives. The presentation highlights how effective storytelling, nostalgia, and customer engagement can drive brand revival and loyalty. Visual narratives and structured communication techniques were used to convey complex business concepts clearly and impactfully.
